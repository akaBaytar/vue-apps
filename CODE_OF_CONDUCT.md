# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Vue Projects repository, I am committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful community. I value the participation of every individual and encourage respectful interactions among contributors.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Violations

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us me soon as possible at [here](mailto:contact@burakbilgili.co.uk). 
All reports will be handled with confidentiality.
